August
--------
1> domain deductions seperately handled: boolean_inference, numerical_inference
2> guardlb variable not checked in is_complete procedure 
3> ssa_enabling_expr checked for worklist update
4> remove_var procedure -- logic negated 

September
---------

October
------
1> update function in acdl_worklist_ordered.cpp now handles assertion outside
loop. This change has to be done since we do not have SSA nodes any more, so 
we can not identify is a statement is of type ID_assert

December
--------
1> Octagon constraint generation -- no sum and difference constraint 
generated for variables with same name but different indexes, no constraint
generated for variables in different procedures. 

2> No decision on "cond" variables in assumption statements 
like (cond21 == (x>2 && x<10));

3> Determining the non-gamma-complete variables based on live variable. 
Follow github issue #52.

4> We use SAT to detemine conjunction(SSA,val) where val is obtained after 
making concrete decisions in the gamma-complete check phase. If
conjunction(SSA,val) is SAT, then there is a counterexample. However, if it is 
UNSAT, can we feedback that information to the conflict graph. Presently, the 
decision and deductions in gamma-complete phase are not incorporated with the 
conflict graph.
